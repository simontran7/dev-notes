## Memory Hierarchy

<img src="images/cache-hierarchy.png" width="500">

Memory hierarchy is typically divided into two broad categories:
- **Primary storage**: Devices the CPU can access directly using its instruction set, including registers, caches, and main memory. These devices are **volatile**, meaning they do _not_ retain data when power is lost.
- **Secondary storage**: Devices that the CPU cannot access directly, requiring data to first be copied into primary storage before the CPU can operate on it. These devices are **persistent** or **non-volatile**, meaning they retain data when there are power outages.

Performance is evaluated primarily along two dimensions:
- **Memory access latency**: the time required for a device to deliver requested data after being instructed to do so, measured in time units (nanoseconds, milliseconds) or CPU cycles
- **Memory bandwidth** (or **throughput**): the amount of data that can be transferred between the device and main memory per unit time, typically measured in bytes per second.

These two metrics are influenced by two key factors:
- The distance from the CPU plays a crucial role, as devices closer to the CPU's processing units can deliver data more quickly.
- The underlying technology of the storage medium heavily influences performance. Registers and caches rely on extremely simple, compact circuits made of only a few logic gates, allowing signals to propagate almost instantly, while mechanical hard drives suffer from delays of 5-15 milliseconds due to the physical need to rotate and align read/write heads.

**Takeaway:** The faster the device, the smaller its storage capacity, and vice versa.

### Primary Storage

Primary storage devices, notably CPU registers, CPU caches, and main memory, consist of **random access memory (RAM)**, meaning the time required to access data remains constant regardless of the data's location within the device.

Primary storage devices follows two main cell memory designs: **Static RAM (SRAM)**, which stores data in small electrical circuits and represents the fastest type of memory used to build registers and caches, and **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**, which stores data using capacitors that hold electrical charges and must frequently refresh these charges to maintain stored values, making it ideal for implementing main memory.

### Secondary Storage

The two most common secondary storage devices today are **hard disk drives** (HDDs) and flash-based **solid-state drives** (SSDs).

A hard drive consists of several flat, circular **platters**. Each platter has a upper surface and lower surface. Each surface is organized in concentric rings called **tracks**, and each track consists of **sectors** separated by **gaps**. Additionally, aligned tracks form a **cylinder**. In the centre of each platter, sits a **spindle**.

To read or write data, the mechanical **arms**, all attached to an **actuator**, where each arm with a **read/write head** at its tip, moves (i.e., extending or retracting) in unison across the platter to position the head over the cylinder containing the target sector (i.e., the sector holding the desired data). This step introduces a performance metric called **seek time**, where the typical average seek time is 3 to 5 ms. Then, the platters spins in counter-clockwise so that the target sector sits under the head. This step also introduces a performance metric called **rotational latency**, where the average rotational latency (in seconds) is found by $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{\text{RPM}} \times \frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{1 \text{ min}}$. Lastly, the data is read, where this step introduces a last performance metric called **transfer time**, calculated by $\frac{1}{\text{RPM}} \times \frac{1}{\text{average sectors per track}} \times \frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{1 \text{ min}}$

## Locality of Reference

**Locality of reference** refers to the memory access pattern of a program where programs tend to use instructions and data with addresses near or equal to those they have used recently. There are two forms of locality: **temporal locality**, which refers to the pattern where a program is likely to access recently referenced items again in the near future, while **spatial locality** refers to the pattern where a program tend to access data that is nearby (in terms of memory address) to previously accessed data.

## Caching

### Background

To understand why caches are important, we have to understand the processor-memory bottleneck problem. According to **Moore's law**, the number of transistors on microchips, and therefore processor performance, will double every two years. However, memory bus bandwidth improved much more slowly over the same period. This created a growing gap in improvement, where increasingly powerful processors were starved for data because they could request information faster than the memory system could deliver it. Caches are the solution which bridge this performance gap by.

A **cache** is computer memory with short access time built directly into your CPU used for storing copies of frequently or recently used instructions or data from main memory.

Cache is made of small chunks of mirrored main memory, where a single chunk is called a **cache line**, typically 64 bytes. The cache can only load and store memory in multiples of a cache line (i.e., the data transfer unit of a cache line is a cache line).

### Mechanics

#### Cache Hit and Cache Miss

There are two main outcomes when the CPU requests memory from the cache: when the cache line containing the requested memory address exists in the cache, we call the outcome a **cache hit**, and the line is returned to the CPU.

However, when the cache line containing the requested memory address isn't cached, we call the outcome a **cache miss**, where the CPU must first wait for the cache line to be loaded from main memory, then stored in the cache, and lastly, returned to the CPU.

There are three primary types of cache misses. A **cold (Compulsory) miss** is a type of cache miss that happens when data is requested for the very first time, and therefore, is not yet present in the cache. A **capacity miss** is a type of cache miss that occurs when the cache is not large enough to hold all the data a program actively needs, called the **working set**, forcing existing data to be evicted to make room for new data. A **conflict miss** is a cache miss that occurs when a memory address maps to a cache location that is already occupied by a different cache line, despite the cache having free space elsewhere. The existing cache line is evicted and replaced with the cache line containing the requested memory address.

### Cache Hierarchy

Modern processors organize caches into a three-tier hierarchy:
* **L1 cache**: the smallest and fastest cache, located directly on each CPU core for immediate access.
* **L2 cache**: larger and a bit slower than L1, usually dedicated to a single core but still very close to it.
* **L3 cache**: the largest and slowest of the three, typically shared among all cores on the processor to coordinate data efficiently.

| Level | Size          |
| ----- | ------------- |
| L1    | 32 KiB (each) |
| L2    | 256 KiB       |
| L3    | 8000 KiB      |

#### Instruction Cache and Data Cache

L1 caches are typically split into **instruction caches (I-cache)** and **data caches (D-cache)**, following the **Harvard Architecture** design principle.

The primary advantage of separating instruction and data caches is eliminating contention between instruction fetches and data accesses. A CPU typically needs to fetch instructions every cycle to keep the pipeline fed, while simultaneously loading and storing data for instructions already in execution. With a unified cache, instruction fetches and data accesses occurring in the same cycle would compete for the same **cache port** â€” the read/write access path into the cache's memory array. This competition creates a **structural hazard**, where multiple operations compete for the same hardware resource simultaneously, forcing the CPU to stall one operation until the resource becomes available. By splitting the L1 cache, instruction fetches and data accesses can occur simultaneously without interference. This parallelism keeps the pipeline busier and increases **instructions per cycle (IPC)**, directly improving processor performance.

Separate caches also provide valuable design flexibility. Instruction streams exhibit predictable characteristics: they follow mostly sequential access patterns, are highly predictable, and are rarely self-modifying. In contrast, data accesses are more random and frequently involve writes. This behavioral difference allows hardware designers to optimize each cache type:
- **I-cache optimization**: Can be designed as read-only with sequential access patterns, enabling aggressive prefetching of subsequent instruction lines while avoiding the complexity and cost of write-back circuits, cache invalidation logic, and coherency protocols.
- **D-cache optimization**: Must handle the full complexity of read/write operations, cache coherency, and the unpredictable access patterns typical of data operations.

### Cache Placement Policies

**Cache placement policies** are policies that determine where a particular memory address can be placed when it goes into a cache.

A **fully-associative cache** is a cache where a memory blocks are free to be stored anywhere in the cache. During each memory access, the system checks _every_ cache line for the data in parallel, but it still remains a fairly expensive operation for reasonably-sized caches.

To address this inefficiency, caches impose restrictions on where specific memory blocks can reside. However, it does bring along a tradeoff. Since the cache is dramatically smaller than main memory, multiple memory addresses must inevitably map to the same cache locations â€” a phenomenon called **cache aliasing**. When two aliased addresses are frequently accessed and modified, they compete for the same cache line, creating what's known as **cache line contention**.

A **set-associative cache** is a cache where a memory block maps to a specific **set** (i.e., a compartment of the cache), according to the index field encoded in the memory block's address. Each of the sets contains $N$ cache lines, where we typically specify a cache as **$N$-way set-associative**. The cache hardware uses the index field of the requested memory address to select a set of the cache, then within that set, it will search all $N$ cache lines in parallel.

A **direct-mapped cache** maps each memory block to exactly one specific cache line based on the index field encoded in the memory block's address. No searching is needed, as the hardware directly computes which single cache line to check.

### Cache Write Policies

Cache reads do not involve upholding consistency with main memory. However, for cache writes, the CPU _must_ decide how to handle updates to the underlying main memory.

A **write-through cache** immediately propagates all writes to main memory whenever the cache is modified. This ensures that cache and main memory remain synchronized at all times.

A **write-back cache** defers writes to main memory until absolutely necessary. Cache lines that have been modified but not yet written to main memory are marked as **dirty**. These dirty lines are only written back when the cache line is evicted or when explicitly flushed.

Write-back caches offer superior performance since they minimize main memory accesses. However, this comes with a trade-off: when a dirty cache line must be evicted, two memory operations are required: first writing the dirty data back to memory, then loading the replacement data.

### Cache Replacement Policies

When the cache is full, it must evict a cache line to make room for a new one. We call the algorithms executed by the processor that determines which cache line to evict as **cache replacement policies**.
